Description: # LUCK: LUigi-based Compiling Kit 
        
        ## Overview:
        
        Makefile is traditional and is great. But makefile can be difficult to debug, interrupt. 
        In contrast, pdb module in python allows very easy high-level debugging as compared to gdb.
        Since my quick search did not reveal any obvious Python alternative to gnu-make, I decided
        to adapt the well-known pipeline manager [**luigi**](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) to 
        check and resolve the dependency.
        
        This is so far a personal project that helped me understood how luigi works, but if anyone
        find this useful, feel free to write documentation / extension modules and make issues/PR.
        
        ## Improvements:
        
        - Performance is not tested at all.
        - Python is not the best language for writing a build system because of its poor portability.
        I am using python because it is more expressive than a static yaml/json file. It would be 
        great if we can write a parser in c/cpp/go to emulate a reduced version of python.
        - profiling gprof
        - dry run dependency graph
